#Makerbistro
###Using Model Associations to create a restaurant menu

Base code taken from [makersquare/makerbistro](https://github.com/makersquare/makerbistro/tree/start-branch).

####Goals:
- The homepage should be a list of all the menu items.
- You should be able to add a new menu item on the home page through a form.
- Menu items should have a name and a list of ingredients displayed on the homepage.
- When you click on a menu item, you should get a page just for that menu item.
	- You should be able to edit the menu item on this page, as well as add new ingredients through a form.


####Steps:
- Check your existing schema and create the necessary models.
- Associate the models.
- Make sure the models work as you expect in the Rails console. Try adding some records and accessing items from a relationship.
- Build out your views as descibed in the 'goals' above. This won't be pretty but it will function properly.
