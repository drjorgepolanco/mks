  Write a simplified restaurant reservation directory:

  - Assign three variables to three different names
    - We'll call each of these a reservation

  - Prompt the user for a name
    - If the name is a reservation, welcome the user and mark the reservation as claimed
    - If the name is a claimed reservation, tell the user that reservation has already been taken
    - Otherwise, tell the user they need to make a reservation
