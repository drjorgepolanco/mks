#MakerSquare JavaScript
##Cohort 3

This represents the JavaScript Lessons that were part of my Cohort at [MakerSquare](http://www.makersquare.com/). 

**There present exercises are only the one that were not meant to be completed in MakerSquare's Learn App.**

The correct order is as follows:

- [Restaurant Reservations](https://github.com/drjorgepolanco/mks/blob/master/immersive/javascript/restaurant_reservation.html): Final exercise of the first lesson **JavaScript Basics**.
- [JavaScript Basics 2](https://github.com/drjorgepolanco/mks/blob/master/immersive/javascript/javascript_basics_2.html): Exercises from the 2nd lesson.
- [Guess the Number](https://github.com/drjorgepolanco/mks/blob/master/immersive/javascript/guess-the-number.html): Number guessing game with vanilla JavaScript, also part of the 2nd lesson: **JavaScript Basics 2**.
- [JavaScript Functions](): Introduction to Js Functions.
- [Lock Box](): Simple Js and jQuery exercise from lesson 3: **JavaScript Functions**.
- [Guess the Number with jQuery](): This second version of the previuos [Number Guessing Game](https://github.com/drjorgepolanco/mks/blob/master/immersive/javascript/guess-the-number.html), is considerable more complicated and touches Object Oriented Programming and a wonderful practice on **jQuery**, **Control Flow** and **Functions**. It is also using **Boostrap**.
- [JavaScript Callbacks](https://github.com/drjorgepolanco/mks/blob/master/immersive/javascript/callbacks.html):
