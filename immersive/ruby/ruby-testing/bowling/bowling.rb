# Bowling is 10 frames long, and normally you get two rolls for each frame, 
# or 20 total per game (unless you get strikes or spares).

# Spare: the score for the frame is 10 plus the number of pins knocked down on the next roll.

# Strike: score for the frame is ten plus the simple total of the pins knocked down in the next two rolls.
