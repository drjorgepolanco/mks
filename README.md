##[MakerSquare lessons](http://www.makersquare.com/)

I was part of the 3rd cohort of [MakerSquare](http://www.makersquare.com/) **from the first week of November 2013 to the last week of January 2014**, in Austin, TX.

I first created this repository while learning and doing the lessons every day, but at the end of the program I realized that due to my rookieness, it was filled with broken code.

I decided to deleted all those related repositories and go through the whole program again, putting every single code inside a single mother repository. **mks.**

This second try aims to curate my code and make sure that everything I push is because it works and because I understand what is going on. 

This repository is a representation of **MakerSquare** lessons and exercises. A very important part of the provided material is not available here because they are meant to be completed in their Learn App or other web based platforms. That's why it will be common to see exercise's titles with jumping numbers.

**There are two main subdirectories:**

- **[Immersive Prework](https://github.com/drjorgepolanco/mks/tree/master/immersive_prework):** Represents exercises that the student is supposed to go through before the first day of the program. More than half is not present here.
- **[Immersive](https://github.com/drjorgepolanco/mks/tree/master/immersive):** Represents the exercises that were specifically part of my cohort: **Cohort 3**.

**The other subdirectories are no less relevant and represent exercises and lessons that are part of MakerSquare but that were not specifically part of my Cohort.** This happens because as alumni we have access to the lessons they create after we finish the program.

####Disclaimer

After writing a couple thousand lines of code I realized that Github and Tabs doesn't necessarily like each other as much as I first thought. That being said, you are likely to see code with funky indentation. I fix them every time I found a new one, but this is still an ongoing process. Please, pardon me and acknowledge that we all love properly indented code and that even if some of my remote code looks funky, my local files are flawless.
