###Data Structure Modeling 2

#####[MakerSquare](http://www.makersquare.com/)

Being one of the most fundamental skills in programming, **Data Structure Modeling** is the art of representing real world data as **data structures**.

In the previous lesson you designed data structures that represented real world data. In this lesson you will be writing the code to create those data structures as **objects**.

The difference between an **object** and a **hash** is that objects don't have just data - they also have **behavior**.

Using **objects** instead of **hashes** allow us to combine **encapsulation** with **behavior**:

- **Encapsulation** is the practice of "protecting" an object's data from the outside coding world.
- **Behavior** represents the different ways we can interact with the object.
