#Data Structure Modeling 2
##A List of Recipes

Assuming we will need to sort ingredients by amount, write an array (or hash) and object representation of the following data:

- **apple salad**
  	- serves 4
	- 6 oz mixed greens
	- 1 tbs honey mustard
	- 2 tbs almonds
	- 4 apples
	- salt and pepper

- **bean burgers**
	- serves 4
	- 2 lbs black beans
	- 4 buns
	- lettuce
	- 8 tomatoes, sliced thinly
	- 1 cup feta cheese
	- mustard

- **avocado soup**
	- serves 2
	- 1 avocado
	- 1 soup
	- cookies
