#Cars Project
##Test Driven Development

Base code taken from [makersquare/ruby-course](https://github.com/makersquare/ruby-course/tree/cars)

**See other little projects about Cars [here](https://github.com/drjorgepolanco/mks/tree/master/immersive_prework/ruby/cars_app) and [here](https://github.com/drjorgepolanco/mks/blob/master/immersive_prework/ruby/car.rb).**

###Topics:
- **Inheritance & the use of keyword `super`.**
- **Class methods.**

###Challenges
- Override `BigRig` methods inherited from `Cars`.
- Override `Initialize`.
- Call `super` with **arguments**.
- Create **class methods** to calculate the **most** and **least** popular car color.
