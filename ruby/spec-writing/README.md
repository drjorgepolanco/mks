#Spec-Writing
##Test Driven Development

Base coden taken from [makersquare/ruby-course](https://github.com/makersquare/ruby-course/tree/spec-writing)

###Completing the Exercises
You must **write tests** for each exercise and make them pass.

Write your specs **first**, THEN go back and implement your method. Here are the steps to take for each exercise:

- Write a test for **one requirement** of `ex0`.
- Run **rspec** and watch your test fail.
- Implement the `ex0` method
- Run your tests again. If red, go back to step 3. If green, congrats!
